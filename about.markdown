Throughout my career, I have designed and implemented software systems, web, mobile and desktop applications. My roles have included being a technical lead, software engineering, mentoring developers and providing on-site support. I was also a research professor with backgrounds in HCI, R&D and computer science.

I earned a MSc. Degree in Computer Science from [CICESE Research Centre](https://www.cicese.edu.mx/) and a degree in Computer Systems from [UAdeO](https://www.uadeo.mx/).

During my Masterâ€™s studies I did research in Human-Computer Interaction and Ubiquitous computing. My research thesis was about designing a browsing system for the Internet of Things using augmented reality, contextual services and semantic web technologies.

On my spare time, I enjoy playing electric guitar, reading, spending time with my family, jogging, doing research and experiment with software.
