My research is focused on interactive systems and ubiquitous computing environments.

I am interested in the design and implementation of cross device interactions, novel user interfaces for smart environments and software applications to enhance people’s lives.

More generally, I seek to understand how to design and use technology that help people be more productive and efficient by means of collaborative and interactive systems.

You can find samples of past projects on my [projects page](/projects/).
