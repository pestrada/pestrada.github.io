I was invited to conduct a workshop on Android development in Colima, Mexico.

All the assistants were experienced with different technology stacks. The workshop was taught with a fast-paced and hands-on approach, demonstrating the following key Android features:

- Activities and Fragments
- Layouts and style attributes
- UI components and Events
- Toasts, dialogs and menus
- Threads for background tasks
- WebView for Web mobile apps

The workshop was held in CocoWorking, an open and collaborative working office for software engineers and technology enthusiasts. Special thanks to Hugo Hernandez ([Don Chambitas](http://donchambitas.com/)) for facilitating this place.
