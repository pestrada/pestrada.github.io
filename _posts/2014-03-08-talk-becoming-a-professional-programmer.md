I gave a talk at [Scio Consulting](http://www.scio.com.mx/) about what it takes to be a Professional Programmer.

My thanks to my colleagues and the audience for a great discussion after the talk.

We had an enriching experience hearing opinions and comments from all the assistants.

This is a video recording of the talk (Spanish audio):
