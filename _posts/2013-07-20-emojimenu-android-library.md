Today I have published an open source library for adding an Emoji keyboard to Android applications.

I needed to add Emoji support to an Android project and implemented a pluggable keyboard. A colleague and I made some additional enhancements and decided to extract the component as an open source library.

So, this is [Emojimenu](https://github.com/pestrada/emojimenu) =)
