During my Master of Science thesis, under the supervision of [Dr. J. Antonio Garcia Macias](http://usuario.cicese.mx/~jagm/), my research topic evolved from [navigating augmented spaces with scenario-based applications](/projects/2013/05/08/medication-intake-augmented-reality-system/) to a complete general-purpose browsing system for the Internet of Things. This browser was called the ‘Sentient Visor’.

Information heterogeneity becomes a problem for a user trying to consume data from augmented objects. Having a dedicated application and asking a user to install a particular software for each type of object would be undesirable. To avoid this situation, we proposed a design space to develop sentient visors that allow browsing the information space in the Internet of Things, consisting of six design dimensions:

- contextual reasoning
- context awareness
- mixed-reality UI
- multimodal information
- object ID/discovery
- semantic communication.

I implemented a Sentient Visor system prototype capable of searching, identifying and communicating with smart objects nearby. The system allows a user to consume web services provided by smart objects without requiring previous knowledge of the services provided or technologies embedded in the object.
