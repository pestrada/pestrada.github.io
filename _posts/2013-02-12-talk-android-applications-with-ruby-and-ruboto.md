---
I was invited to give a talk about Android development to the Google Developers Group Tijuana at [BIT Center Tijuana](http://bitcenter.mx).

On this talk I demonstrated how to use [Ruboto](http://ruboto.org) to develop native Android applications using the [Ruby programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org).
